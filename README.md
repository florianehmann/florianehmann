### Hi there,

I'm Florian Ehmann, a Theoretical Physicist and Data Scientist.

Currently I'm working the [twitter-emotion](https://github.com/florianehmann/twitter-emotion) project that uses AI language models to detect emotions in short snippets of text, e.g. tweets. I also created a Flask-based [webapp](https://feelthetweet.com) in [twitter-emotion-webapp](https://github.com/florianehmann/twitter-emotion-webapp) that let's user query the model I created on their custom tweets.

If you're looking to get in touch with me, just write me message on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/florian-ehmann)!
