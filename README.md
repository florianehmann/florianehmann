### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Florian Ehmann, a Data Scientist by profession and a Theoretical Physicist by trade with a lifelong passion for technology.

I'm currently working the [twitter-emotion](https://github.com/florianehmann/twitter-emotion) project to advance and demonstrate my skills in creating NLP applications. Right now I'm creating a Flask-based web application in [twitter-emotion-webapp](https://github.com/florianehmann/twitter-emotion-webapp) that let's user query the model I set up on their custom tweets.

If you're looking to get in touch with me, just write me message on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/florian-ehmann)!
